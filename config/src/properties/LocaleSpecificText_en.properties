# Locale Specific Text Bundle (Default - English)
#
#
# This file contains text that must be localized for display.
#
# Localized strings used in user interfaces should be specified
# in the following format:
#
#    <vendorID>.<application>.<field> = <value>
#
# where <vendorID> is the software vendor ID, <application> is the name of the application containing
# the text, <field> is the name of the UI field (logical), and <value> is the actual text
# to be displayed.  For example:
#
#    vendor.operationbrowser.description = Description
# 
# You may override base application properties by using the base property key
# with a new text value.
