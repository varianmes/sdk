# Locale Specific Resource Bundle (Default - English)
#
# This file contains resources that can be localized for display.
#
# Each line contains a bundle key and value in the following format:
#
#    <vendorID>.<context>.<type> = <URI>
#
# where <vendorID> is the software vendor ID, <context> is an additional modifier
# describing the context of the resource, <type> describes the type of the
# resource (IMAGE, HELP, etc), and <URI> is the URI of the resource. For example
#
#    acme.logo.IMAGE = /../../web-ext/images/BigLogo.gif
#
# NOTE: If using a relative URL, the leading '/../../' is required to escape the base 
# application context path.
#
# You may override base application resource properties by using the base property key
# with a new text value.
